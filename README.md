### About Me
Hey there!  I'm @BorgRancher, a driven mobile developer (iOS & Android) on a quest to make the extraordinary ordinary with tech. Miracles are performed before breakfast, the utterly impossible might take a little longer.

I'm particularly fascinated by the possibilities of AI and Computer Vision, especially their positive, non-dystopian applications!  Think AI that makes your life easier, not creepier.

My superpower?  Helping humans and tech become the ultimate dream team.  I'm a veteran developer (Java, Kotlin, C++, Objective-C, Swift) who loves streamlining multi-platform development.  Remember that bewildered feeling when you first started?  I'm here to make that a thing of the past!

Beyond the code, I'm all about using tech to solve real problems for real people.  Everyone deserves the benefits of a tech-powered world!  Let's collaborate and make a positive impact together.
